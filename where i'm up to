in app.js, trying to get the function to work to 
do something when the user wins or gets 10 points


this function works, if i attach it to an onClick on a random button in index.html 
Need to make it be an event listener
function winner() {
    alert("winner winner chicken dinner")
}


Could do with changing it to sass
