# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spck

Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock is a game of chance played by one user against the computer.

                     Scissors cuts Paper 

                    Paper covers Rock 

                    Rock crushes Lizard 

                    Lizard poisons Spock
                    
                    Spock smashes Scissors 

                    Scissors decapitates Lizard 

                    Lizard eats Paper 

                    Paper disproves Spock 

                    Spock vaporizes Rock 

                    (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
